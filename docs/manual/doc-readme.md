# Legacy Doc README

This note comes from the original `vendor/xindy-2.1/Doc/README`
(February 1997) and explains the contents of the legacy documentation
tree. The GNU Info and plain text variants were auto-generated from SGML
and can be clumsy; the TeX and HTML versions look better. The `tutorial`
subdirectory contains the examples used in the tutorial.
