# xindy Manual

This is the migrated copy of the historic xindy 2.0 manual (Edition: February 1998) that
previously lived as HTML under `xindy-src/xindy-2.1/Doc/`. The content is unchanged aside
from light Markdown formatting so it is easier to browse alongside the rest of the docs.
Images referenced by the manual now live in `docs/assets/`.
