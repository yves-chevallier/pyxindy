# About this Manual

We assume that the reader is already familiar with the task of an
index processor and has basic experience in using a markup-based
document preparation systems such as TeX/LaTeX [1, 2],
the roff-family or SGML-based systems (e.g. its instance HTML).

For a basic introduction into the handling and using of **xindy**
refer to the tutorial that comes with this distribution.

This document is structured as follows. The second part gives an
overview on the index model that is used by our system and we define
general concepts and terms. The third part contains a list of all
index style commands, their syntax, and a description of their
purpose. The reader should at least have read the first part of the
manual to understand the basic terminology to be able to use the
command reference. The fourth part describes how **xindy** can be
invoked, what command line options are available and more. The fifth
part describes the different processing phases the system runs
through.
