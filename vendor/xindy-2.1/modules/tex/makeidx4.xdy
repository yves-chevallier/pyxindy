;; This module is intended to work with makeindex4. It is like
;; makeidx.xdy withput all declarations that are performed by
;; makeindex4.
;;

;; This file implements the Output Style Specifiers for plain
;; makeindex (see manpage of makeindex 2.x) in conjuction with
;; TeX/LaTeX.
;;
;; The Input Style Specifiers of makeindex cannot de defined in a
;; `xindy' style file. Use an appropriate version of the program
;; `tex2xindy' which should be included with this distribution.
;;
;; Since `xindy' uses a different specification language than
;; makeindex and some of the command-line options of makeindex are now
;; only available as style-file commands, this file can only serve as
;; a template that produces the default-markup of makeindex. However,
;; it may be used as a starting point for further modification and
;; specialization.
;;
;; The following values are taken from the source of the makeindex
;; distribution (see file scanst.h and the manpage) for further
;; details.
;;

;;
;; The definiton of attributes and location classes is already done by
;; makeindex4. Here follows the rest of all declarations.
;;

;; preamble <string>        "\\begin{theindex}\n"
;; postamble <string>       "\n\n\\end{theindex}\n"

(markup-index :open  "\begin{theindex}~n"
	      :close "~n~n\end{theindex}~n"
	      :tree)

;; These specifiers are not directly supported via a command-line
;; switch as in makeindex. Add the appropriate markup-commands into
;; the preamble.

;; setpage_prefix <string>  "~n  \setcounter{page}{"
;; setpage_suffix <string>  "}~n"

;; group_skip <string>      "~n~n  \indexspace~n"

(markup-letter-group-list :sep "~n~n  \indexspace~n")

;; The indexentries (item_<..> specifiers)

(markup-indexentry :open "~n  \item "           :depth 0)
(markup-indexentry :open "~n    \subitem "      :depth 1)

(markup-locref-list   :sep ", ")

;; delim_r <string>         "--"

(markup-range :sep "--")

;; Here follow all letter-groups. The short-cut notation is used here.

     "n" "o" "p" "q" "r" "s" "t" "u" "v" "w" "x" "y" "z"))
