xindy is largely written in Common Lisp. We have chosen Common Lisp
for several reasons. Common Lisp is a very powerful rapid prototyping
framework that allows for an efficient and maintainable
implementation. We started using C++ and soon switched to Lisp gaining
an productivity improvement by a significant factor. Since we make
heavy use of the object-oriented features of CLOS, the Common Lisp
Object System, and the dynamic nature of Lisp, thus other Lisp systems
such as Emacs-Lisp will not work.

We have chosen the Common Lisp implementation CLISP as the system of
our choice, since CLISP runs on all commonly used platforms ranging
from DOS/Windows (NT), OS/2 to many UNIX flavors. CLISP has a
relatively small memory footprint (2-4 MB) and is reasonably fast
compared to other Lisp systems.

For efficiency reasons we have added the GNU Rx regular expression
library and it has been extended with around 500 lines of C-code. The
additional parts are only necessary if one uses the keyword-mapping
features of xindy, which is one of the central parts of the system.
But it should be usable without these features, too.

It has also been tested on Allegro Common Lisp though it still lacks
the keywork mapping support.

Currently we offer several binary distributions to free the users from
porting the Lisp system on their own. A full source version will be
available soon.
