	* Walter Obermiller <walter@sbart.stuttgart.netsurf.de> has
    	  successfully ported xindy-2.0 to SunOS-4.1.1 on a Sparc-1.

Tue Jan  6 17:35:53 1998  Roger Kehr  <kehr@spirit>

	* Opened the module library on the web.

	* Started work on making xindy learn Irish. The Irish rules cannot
          be expressed in the current implementation. Padraig De Brun
 	  <pdebrun@celt.dias.ie> pointed me to that problem and helped to
          find a solution.

	* Announce of version 2.0 alpha release on the mailing list.

Mon Oct 20 13:30:39 1997  Roger Kehr  <kehr@sponsor>

	* Put a patch for 1.2.2 on the web. New version is 1.2.3.

	* Implemented an extension to the sorting rule mechanism that now
	  allows the definition of German and French sorting rules by
	  using multiple sorting phases. The old scheme did not have a
 	  good support for complex sorting rules.

	* Joerg Diederich <J_Diederich@herlab.ruhr.de> did finish the OS/2
	  port. Release of OS/2 version.

Thu Apr  3 15:46:24 1997  Roger Kehr  <kehr@spock>

	* Rewrote the xindy shell-script wrapper. It is now written in
	  perl, because perl is better supported on non-UNIX platforms
	  such as OS/2.

Fri Mar 28 14:05:05 1997  Roger Kehr  <kehr@spock>

        * Released interim version 1.2.2

	* Fixed several pieces of the code to make it more ANSI-compliant.
	  Switched to Allegro CL as the development platform.
	  xindy now runs on Allegro CL. Still missing is the support for
	  sort- and merge-rules.

Mon Feb 24 15:53:26 1997  Roger Kehr  <kehr@spock>

	* Made a new binary release for Sun Solaris. The new version now
	  runs on Solaris 2.[4, 5, 5.1] for sun4m and sun4u (Ultra
	  machines). Therefore we will support only one version for all
	  Sun platforms. New new binary release has version 1.0c. The
	  change is possible with a special patch for clisp making the
	  format of the dump-files equal.
	  Bug was reported by Peter Seitz <seitz@informatik.th-darmstadt.de>.

        * Released version 1.0a. This is a snapshot of the upcoming
          release 1.1.

        * This release is not compatible to version 1.0. We have decided
          to represent meta-characters inside of strings in the style
          files to be prefixed with `~' instead of `\'.

        * It contains many new features and bug-fixes.

Fri Aug  2 19:57:58 1996  Roger Kehr  <kehr@spock>

	* Revisited the manual and the tutorial. Now both are available as
	  versions 1.0.
