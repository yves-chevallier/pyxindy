This file describes how to install xindy on your system:

xindy is divided into two packages. A machine dependent one and a
independent one. Since we expect that the machine dependent parts will
rarely need patches, we separated both. After unpacking the archives
you will obtain the following directory structure:


 xindy/		      The TOPLEVEL directory.

  binaries/           Each of the machine-dependent packages will be
		      unpacked into one of the following directories.

        i386-linux-elf/
	rs6000-aix/
        sun4-solaris/


  xindy-<version>/    This is the machine-independent part.

        Doc/          Contains a Manual and a Tutorial in
		      html,dvi,ps,info,txt-formats

        modules/      The library of pre-defined indexstyle-modules

        src/          The source of the xindy-system. Contains several
		      scripts and tools forming the environment of
		      xindy.

        tests/        Contains a complete testsuite

        contrib/      Contains additional programs that can be used to make
      		      xindy work with various document-formatting
      		      systems

1. Take the most recent machine-independent package and unpack it
   using

	gunzip -c xindy-<version>.tar.gz | tar xvf -

   It will unpack itself into the directory ./xindy/xindy-<version>/.

   The directory ./xindy will now be the TOPLEVEL-directory in all
   further steps.

2. Enter the TOPLEVEL directory (see diagram above).

   Now establish the following link

        ln -s xindy-<version> current

   with xindy-<version> being the directory where the most recent
   xindy-package is stored. The following steps use this link to
   select the current xindy-version. Thus you can keep several
   versions in parallel.

3. If you not have received a binary distribution for your preferred
   platform(s), get one and unpack it in the TOPLEVEL-directory with

	gunzip -c xindy-<version>-<platform>.tar.gz | tar xvf -

   The binaries will be stored into the directory TOPLEVEL/binaries/<platform>.

4. a) Change to the directory of the binary-distribution for which you
      want to install the system, e.g.

	  cd ./binaries/<platform>

   b) Modify the `Makefile.platform' and `Makefile.install' to reflect
      your system paths, etc.

      Makefile.install:

        The directory where xindy looks for its runtime-system is

	  LIBDIR    where the main executable `xindy.run', and the dump
		    file `xindy.mem' go.

	  MODULEDIR where the modules go.

        You can also specify a different installation path with the
        variable INSTTOPDIR. Other variables are documented in the
        Makefiles.

      Makefile.platform:

        Defines compiler switches and the path to the Perl executable.


   c) Build all programs by typing

          make all

      Note: This only compiles xindy and modifies some scripts but does
	    *not* install anything!

       After a while (between 30 seconds and 5 minutes--depending on
       your system) you should receive a message saying that the
       compilation has finished. If not, see file PROBLEMS for further
       hints.

       This step has produced a memory-image of the xindy-system in
       file xindy.mem. This is comparable to a TeX-format file. If you
       like, you can compress this file with gzip by additionally
       typing

	  make gzipped

       which compresses xindy.mem and stores it under the same name.
       This saves space but can result in a longer startup-phase.

5. The next step would be to run the test suite on the whole system.
   Type

	make testsuite

   to run all tests. This may last some minutes (go, drink a cup of
   coffee) but will hopefully report that it has not found any errors.

6. After everything seems to be ok, you only need to install the
   system.

   If you have set the paths in `Makefile.platform' all files will be
   installed properly. First type

	make -n install

   to check if everything is ok and then install them by typing

	make install

7. Read the manual and go through the tutorial with your preferred
   viewer/browser. They can be found in the Doc-directory.

8. Have fun! (very important)
